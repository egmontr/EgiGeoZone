EgiGeoZone is an Android Geofencing app which uses satellite position hardware in your phone or tablet to 'trigger' different actions when entering or leaving predefined zones that you can choose. It can trigger many actions directly, or simply display a notification on screen to do so. In other words, the app works in a similar way to apps like Tasker, which allows certain events to initiate an action on your smartphone or even a remote server.
