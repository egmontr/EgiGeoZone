This is the source code for **EgiGeoZone** in its last published version 2.7.7.

I have developed this app as a hobby and therefore ask for leniency regarding the code.
I'm not an expert in Android.

I will not continue this app as I am tired of incorporating the Google changes from version to version in the app!

Also, I'm not the youngest to continue.

Maybe someone can fork/branch the project and continue with it. It is expressly desired.
I can help with any questions.

Thanks to all my loyal users worldwide.

**TODO:**
- Migrate to Android 8+ changes like
  - Broadcasts, alarms ...
- Migrate GCM to Firebase
